Turkish Bike Tour,static-map,wisconsin,,"  <p>What would it look like if a Tour de France style bike race took place in Turkey? With this scenario as the challenge I designed a fictional bike race that would have the riders trace Turkey’s two coasts as a means of exploring both how to depict terrain on a country level scale and how to add additional information to a basemap that is already extremely visually dense. </p><p>For this project I generated a shaded relief in ArcMap using a 15 arc minute DEM from <a href=""""http://viewfinderpanoramas.org"""">Viewfinder Panoramas</a> that I then draped landcover information over from the <a href=""""http://www.glcn.org/databases/lc_glcshare_en.jsp"""">FAO</a>. The hillshade and landcover layers in addition to the bathymetry were smoothed and color corrected in Photoshop. Finally  the route was generated using Google My Maps and imported to ArcMap as a KML. All other map layers are Natural Earth data. Vector and Raster layers were combined in Illustrator which is also where the side panel with additional route information and the race logo were generated.</p>"""
Online Etch Map,interactive-map,wisconsin,,"  <p>This tileset was created as a means of exploring both how to translate an artistic style to a map as well as a vehicle to learn CartoCSS. To create this map I referenced images printed in the nineteenth century as a part of the Etching Revival, specifically the etchings of James McNeill Whistler, to recreate a print style which is simultaneously extremely exacting while still feeling intimate and hand-done within the constraints of a webmap  which often feels the opposite.</p>  <p>In order to achieve this I used an extremely limited color palate and instead overlaid textures within the map that I created in photoshop and then tessellated within Mapbox Studio Classic. This was done in an attempt to recreate the atmospheric overlaying of thin lines  especially at higher zoom levels.</p>  <p>As a final step  I created an icon set within Illustrator that I then imported into the map to depict places that Whistler lived and worked over the course of his life and galleries which are currently displaying his work.</p>"
Illuminating Crime,graphic,wisconsin,,"  ""<p>As a cartographer who is fascinated by urban spaces individual’s experience of the city I was shocked in September 2016 when Mayor Mural Bowser announced a week long effort to identify street light outages across the District as the first undertaking in her “Safer  Stronger  (Brighter)  DC” public safety agenda. I created this infographic as a means of exploring the relationship between streetlights and safety in DC in an attempt to answer the question “do streetlights actually make us safer?” (Short answer: no  but we feel like they do).</p> <p>This infographic was created using Adobe Illustrator and data from <a href=”http://opendata.dc.gov”>Open Data DC</a>. </p>"
San Fernando Valley Map,static-map,syracuse,,"<p>This map was created for the print edition of the November 2012 AAG Newsletter while I was midway through my very first cartography class. While not the pinnacle of my cartographic career this is the map where I fell in love with the cartographic design process and the constant negotiation involved in depicting place. This map also professionalized cartography for me: it changed the way I thought about making maps from something that was done in school to a potential career path in its own right. And as if the map was not already significant enough  it also allowed me to get my foot in the door at AAG  where through its creation I worked closely with the fantastic Communications team that I would later join.</p> <p><em>Main takeway</em>: If Mark Monmonier asks if you want to take on a side project  you say yes and don’t look back. It might change your life.</p> <p>To read Eric D.
