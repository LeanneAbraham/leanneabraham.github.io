	<p class="atlas header">When I visit a new city my favorite way to explore is through my stomach. I set out hoping to find those hidden gems known only to locals, the secret corners of the city that make it unique. Increasingly I find that I cultivate my experience not through a romanticized aimless wandering but through the careful culling of the aggregate experiences of others. My engagement with the city becomes dependent on a set of attributes I had no input into. What don’t I see? What flavors do I miss?</p>

		<h2 align="center">Food Scene | Food Unseen</h2><br>
			<p>Often the conversations about a food scene in a city are dominated by the new and the next. Mixologists, small plates, unusual flavor combinations. This restaurant culture has a clear geography across Madison, concentrated on the Isthmus it is easy to forget that it is possible to eat beyond this strip of land.</p>
			<p>To contrast and complicate this single, dominating food culture I chose to map the locations of Madison’s food pantries. Unassuming and endlessly essential they are sprinkled throughout the city, sometimes even sharing a block with trendiest restaurants in the city. This map is a reminder that there will always be portions of the city that will remain unseen even when they appear to be in plain sight.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Lost Gems</h2>
			<br>
			<p>This map is meant to serve as a subtle reminder of the layers of memories that can accumulate within a city as the landscape of the built environment shifts and residents come and go. Behind each of these businesses is a story, not just of the owners but of the patrons and the community. These are stories of battles with cancer and rising rents, personal stories that are obscured when the storefront closes. These are the places that live on in the hearts and minds of those who knew them, and continue to live on in the fabric of the city regardless of who the next tenant is. But at the same time, these are the places that as people leave the city and new residents take their place, will slowly be lost even to the collective memory.</p>

		<h2 align="center">All Night Diner</h2>
			<br>
			<p>This map is meant to answer the age-old question of where is it possible to grab a bite to eat at 4 am.</p>
			<p>Short answer: you probably can’t.</p>

		<h2 align="center">High Brow | Low Brow</h2>
			<br>
			<p>A number of years ago I was talking to a friend who took the time to explain the economics of their dining out strategy. A lover of good meals who above all else would seek novelty and adventure they managed to change the way I thought about dining out. Their recommendation was a simple one: to never have a boring meal or regret the money spent you needed to avoid the middle of the road. They would make a point to generally steer clear the moderately pricy New American fare where aioli stands in for innovation. Instead, they would actively try to spend their money on the far extremes of the restaurant pricing spectrum, arguing that the best way to be continually wowed is to spend the bulk of their dining out budget in in strip malls and family joints where the food is a labor of love and is made without adjustments for the American palate. They then recommend taking all the money that you save eating bulgogi instead of burgers and treating yourself to those special occasion meals that otherwise seem to always be just out of budget. This strategy has served me well while living on the East Coast, so now I need to know: where should I eat in Madison? </p>

<p>Firstly, I would like to credit Rebecca Solnit, Joshua Jelly Schapiro, and the entire team that has worked on the incredible series of atlases <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520262508">Infinite City</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520274044">Unfathomable City</a></em>, and <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520285958">Nonstop Metropolis</a></em>, that served as the inspiration for this project. Your maps changed the way I think about mapping cities and I hope I did them justice.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Derek Lieu for his javascript prowess and general support.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to thank Ross Thorn, Alicia Iverson, Nick Lally and the Cart Lab community at large for all the advice, ideas, and the general sense of comradery that comes from knowing you are not the only person who has been up all night.</p>
